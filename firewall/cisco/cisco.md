There are many different Cisco devices and many different commands that can be used with each type of device. Some common Cisco device commands include:

show ip route: This command displays the current routing table on a Cisco device.
show interfaces: This command displays information about the interfaces on a Cisco device, such as their status, speed, and MAC address.
show version: This command displays information about the Cisco device's software and hardware, such as the version number, uptime, and hardware model.
configure terminal: This command allows you to enter configuration mode on a Cisco device, where you can modify the device's settings and configurations.
ping: This command allows you to test connectivity to a remote device by sending ICMP echo request messages and displaying the responses.
traceroute: This command allows you to trace the path that packets take to reach a remote device, by sending UDP packets with increasing TTL values and displaying the responses.
copy running-config startup-config: This command saves the current running configuration of a Cisco device to the startup configuration, so that the same configuration is used when the device is restarted.
reload: This command allows you to restart a Cisco device, which can be useful for applying configuration changes or troubleshooting.
These are just a few examples of Cisco device commands. There are many other commands available, depending on the specific device and its capabilities. You can refer to the Cisco documentation for more information.
